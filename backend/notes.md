# A place for notes while developing:


#An option for changing the styles / colors of stripes, and spots.
these all could be just an additional dataset in the creation build.  and example could be: 3 opacity options, light(3), medium(8), and solid (10).  Of course it would be a submissive trait to "Plain" dragons, but could add to the other features of the app. in addition we could rotate the pattern in 90degree segments to create 4 seperate ways the lines or dots appear on the dragon. and more, to really settle the randomness of the build.


## style: 
* rotating the pattern image,
* stretching the pattern image,
* changing the opacity of the pattern image.


## color
 * hue rotation Example:
    filter:hue-rotate(90deg);
