## How to Play
no info available yet

## Reasons for this build
After finishing a fullstack development course, I found it would be a good exersize to review some of the technologies one more time and do a full project.  It's been beneficial to see explanations of David Katz's, and to see his pattern for variable labeling and structuring his functions.  It's also been beneficial to have more time to understand my way through things without the pressure of a weekly deadline. This has allowed me to expand and really tinker with things and understand my mistakes, rather than rushing to get something deployed in the middle of the night.

## Changes made from the course
* bulleted text, explaining differences and choices

## Conclusions
* More of these will exist when app is completed
*
